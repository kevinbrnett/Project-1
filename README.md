# Grocery Store Sales Predictions

## Analyzing Various Factors to Predict Future Sales of Grocery Stores

**Business Problem**:

Help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.
 
## Data Source:

 Original Dataset: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/
 
 In this dataset there are 12 columns and 8523 rows.
 
 ## Data Dictionary:

## To Prepare the dataset, it was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

**Item Sales Count Histogram**

> We can see that the data for item sales and visibility are both skewed to the right. Both of these features also have a significant amount of outliers.

>We can see that medium size outlets account for a majority of sales

## Models Evaluated and Results:

- Linear Regression Model (Testing Set)
  - Model testing MAE: 803.98
  - Model testing MSE: 1194496.09
  - Model testing RMSE: 1092.93
  - Model testing R2: 0.57
 
- Decision Tree Model (Testing set)
  - Model testing MAE: 1044.70
  - Model testing MSE: 2260854.78
  - Model testing RMSE: 1092.93
  - Model testing R2: 0.18
 
## Global Explanations
## SHAP Summary Bar Plot
![image](summary_plot_bar.png)
> Both the SHAP explainer summary plot and the feature importances plot contained the same top 5 features. The only difference is that in the SHAP summary Item_visibility was the 4th most important feature and in the feature importances Item_visibility was the 3rd most important feature.

## SHAP Summary Dot Plot

- Item_MRP:
 - Lower Item_MRP values produce less sales and higher Item_MRP values produce more sales.
- Outlet_Type_Grocery Store:
 - Outlet types that are grocery stores have a negative impact on sales. Sales are higher if the outlet type is not a grocery store.
- Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3:
 - Sales are generally higher for outlet types of supermarket 3. However, if the outlet type is not supermarket 3 there is little to no negative effect on sales.
## Final Recommendations:

The model I recommend using is the linear regression model. The testing model performed better than the decision tree and the training and testing set of the linear regression model performed similarly suggesting that there is low bias.
